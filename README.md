# VRCKinectFaceTracking

This repo serves as a proof of concept that the XBox Kinect 360 may be used for face tracking via VRCFT. Face information is pulled and printed on lines 356-360 (not a coincidence, I swear) in FaceTrackingViewer.xaml.cs.

If enough people take interest to this, I will develop a VRCFT module for screen-mode face tracking based on my findings.
